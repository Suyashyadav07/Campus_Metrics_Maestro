This project aims to perform a detailed department-wise analysis within an engineering institution, focusing on various academic and extracurricular domains.The study will analyze faculty involvement in research publications, patent filings, participation in NPTEL and SWAYAM courses, revenue generation through consultancy, and the implementation of value-added teaching methods. Additionally, the project will evaluate student performance in competitive platforms such as the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) and the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). The data-driven analysis will identify trends, strengths, and areas needing improvement, offering actionable insights to enhance departmental performance and drive academic excellence. The findings will help in strategizing improvements, fostering innovation, and ultimately contributing to the institution's growth and reputation.
